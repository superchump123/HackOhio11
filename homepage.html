<p>At OSU, navigating the buildings can be difficult, whether you're a student, an instructor, or a guest.</p>
<P>Many of the buildings have been renovated multiple times, resulting in confusing floor layouts, making it easy to get lost.</P>
<p>We've developed a way for anyone to generate step-by-step written directions, along with a route map, to navigate from one room in a building to another.</p>
<p>We accomplished this by mapping every room, hallway, staircase, and door to nodes, and finding the shortest path between nodes.</p>
<p>These node paths are translated into step-by-step directions, along with being transcribed to a visual format by drawing lines onto a map.</p>
<p>This makes travel less stressful, reducing the likelihood of getting lost and thus helping users to arrive to their destination in less time.</p>
